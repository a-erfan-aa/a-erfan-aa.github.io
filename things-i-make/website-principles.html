	<h2><u>You're now reading: this website!</u></h2>
	<h4>More specifically, what i thought about when making this website</h4>
</div>

<br><br>

<div><!-- section title and content -->
	<h3>The reason this website exists</h3>
		<p>I just haven't found a place online that i felt like i could really make my own to crosslink, organize and display whatever i wanted so i thought fuck it i'll make it myself.<br>
		Maybe i haven't found that place for lack of trying but why should finding that platform be harder than making it myself like come on the year is 2021 as i'm typing this.</p>
</div>

	<h3>Main thoughts</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>make it all from scratch, none of that premade template wordpress *this video was sponsored by* corporate waaay-too-squeaky-clean lookin ass look</li>
				<ul>
					<li>i was starting to use the internet more while yahoo was a relevant company/brand beyond its answers, so i suppose i'm partially fueled by my nostalgia for a time when running into a scuffed diy website was more common than it is now</li>
					<li>don't get me wrong i have no problems with websites that look like some rich dude's mansion and have animations that move like a space jellyfish through butter, some of them look <a href="https://ajeeb.in/">very cool</a> but that's not the look i want to go for</li>
				</ul>
			<li>usable for people who strictly avoid nonfree software</li>
				<ul>
					<li>if i really need/want javascript, it's gotta be the free kinda js according to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">4 freedoms</a></li>
					<li>other stuff i need to look into</li>
				</ul>
			<li>i spend a lot of time typing thoughts i have into a text editor with typewritery monospace consolas/courier new lookin font so yeah</li>
			<li>i like black, blue and some white because a lot of my stuff is blue, black is easy on the eyes and white is a high contrast from the other two and well fuck now i look like i ripped the color combo from twitter/github/musescore</li>
			<li>needs to be easy to expand upon or change</li>
				<ul>
					<li>early on i thought i could get away with copypasting my "banner" and navbar into every .html but i kept making more .htmls and realised well shit this is gonna be a nightmare to replace if i need to :")</li>
					<li>dog bless <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> with its &#123%include%&#125s </li> <!-- note to self: had to use html entity for { and } because of how liquid or jekyll treats the bracepercent stuff when building -->
				</ul>
			<li>it should easy to tell when a page was created and updated so contents can be taken in with the context of when it was made</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Changes i'd like to make if i could</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>i should probably look into accessibility options like colorblind mode, day/night themes, large text and other common languages in my region but it's daunting</li>
				<ul>
					<li>especially the language part, i can't just shove everything into a translation service because</li>
						<ul>
							<li>i made all these pages (excluding some of the js) from scratch with notepad++ and jekyll. having to dance my plaintext and markup around the &lt;elements&gt; is going to be hell</li>
							<li>i use a lot of abbreviations and nonsense words like awaaga</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
			<li>really wanna figure out how to make the checkboxes not look like they're raised slightly over on <a href="/things-i-like.html">things that i like</a>
		</ul>
