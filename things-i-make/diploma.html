	<h3>What's goin on</h3>
	<p>My seniors before me finished off their diploma in music performance by holding an exit recital of sorts as their final project. I have decided to follow in their footsteps.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">I've had to rework the project and change its scope multiple times since early 2020 due to a global pandemic, scheduling issues and personnel changes but i hope this is the one that sticks and i can finally get it done. It's currently going slower because i've finished attending classes and all my assignments, i don't have a set deadline for the project and part time work and gigs are stealing my attention.</p>

	<h3>How it's goin on</h3>
    <p>There's a lot of other nitty gritty and logistics i didn't list down like writing out charts and booking venues and gear rental and what not but this should give anyone a good idea of where i'm at right now.</p>
