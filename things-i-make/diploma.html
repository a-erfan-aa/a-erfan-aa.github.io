	<h3>What's goin on</h3>
	<p>My seniors before me finished off their diploma in music performance by holding an exit recital of sorts as their final project. I don't feel comfortable doing that because of what i hope are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">obvious reasons</a> so i changed the scope of the project to a live-ish recording of my setlist instead.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">I plan to edit a final product for submissions and a different final product to shove onto my youtube channel because why the heck not. It's a fun enough setlist to show a general audience but i need to maintain some <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">air of professionalism</span> to get my grades so i thought "why not just record once and cut twice?".</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">I've had to rework the project multiple times since early 2020 due to a buncha reasons but i hope this is the one that sticks and i can finally get it done.</p>

	<h3>How it's goin on</h3>
    <p>There's a lot of other nitty gritty and logistics i didn't list down like writing out charts and booking venues and gear rental and what not but this should give anyone a good idea of where i'm at right now.</p>
