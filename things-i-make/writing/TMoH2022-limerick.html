<!-- the limerick -->

	<p>There once was a dude named Trent<br>
	Who uploaded a spooky announcement<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right there on my screen<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this year’s halloween<br>
	An invite to write for enjoyment</p>
	<br>
	<p>We could type up a script of sheer horror<br>
	Or poems of season pre-winter<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or send in a story<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wasn’t too gory<br>
	By the 25th day of September</p>
	<br>
	<p>I wasn’t too sure how to start<br>
	To write of the fear in my heart<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brain I did rack<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon I was on track<br>
	To finish off my work of art</p>
	<br>
	<p>But as the set deadline drew closer<br>
	I somehow became so much busier<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had so much to do<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the writing was due<br>
	By the 25th day of September</p>
	<br>
	<p>I suddenly found myself scared<br>
	That the rush left my writing impaired<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it come across rude?<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it come across crude?<br>
	Should I send in what I had prepared?</p>
	<br>
	<p>So I stopped and I took a quick breather<br>
	To help me stay calm and remember<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That goals, I had none<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides writing for fun<br>
	By the 25th day of September</p>
	<br>
	<p>Well now that my thoughts are serene<br>
	I’m finding myself rather keen<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have my attention<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trained on the collection<br>
	of writings, this Trent Month of Halloween!</p>
