	<h3>so about the writing...</h3>
	<p>I've got stuff floating around in my drafts, like original(?) boardgame rulesets, short stories and methods i use to make music, but as of when this page was last edited i don't/didn't plan on focusing on writing as much as my other creative endeavours. Which is a shame because i really do value the drafts i have so far, but i have limited time and attention.</p>
