	<h4>Hopefully every single thing i've done, big and small, for any reason<br>
	Click/tap <a href="https://epk.onlyerfans.com">here</a> instead if you want to read about my experiences from a more <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">professional</span> standpoint</h4>

	<h3>Foreword</h3>
	<p>I've done a fair bit of music related things since i was a child. As a result of that, i've done things that i'm both proud and not so proud to have done and that's why i don't bring it up much. But i have to acknowledge that i've done them and try to keep track of what i've been up to for most of my life. Mostly to make resume writing and job applications easier on myself.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 50px;">I'll try to keep the list comprehensive but i'm not going to list out every single recurring weekly recording session or bargig as seperate bullet points. i also started writing this in 2022, so some things i've done far in the past have begun to slip away from my memory.</p>
