	<h3>My other names and tags</h3>
	<p>My name's abang erfan, pronounced ah·bahng air·fahn, <span style="color: green;font-size: 150%;">you can call me erfan</span> for short. There are a couple people who call me abang but that's pretty much a... family name? Afaik there isn't a clear analogue between malay <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_names">malaysian names</a> to the western firstnamelastname format of names. <span style="color: green;font-size: 150%;">You can also call me kurt</span> since that's the screenname i roll with, and <i>definitely nothing else</i>.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 50px;">The whole website is pretty much an aboutme so i'd encourage you to go through the other pages if you wanna know more.</p>
