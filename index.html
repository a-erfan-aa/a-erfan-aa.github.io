	<h3>Some things that you should know regarding this website or me</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This is a personal website okay? don't expect any professionallismsm here</li>
			<li>Generally, regular text is blue, links are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">white</a> and super important stuff is either <span style="color: red;">red</span> or <span style="color: green;">green</span>. i might break the format sometimes if i want though.</li>
			<li>The lastChanged of a page reflects the last time a noticeable change of its content happened, i won't increment it for small changes like spelling errors or grammar improvements.</li>
			<li>I want this website to be as accessible as possible to free software users.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>There are some scripts around to help hide bloat but i hope it's readable and still free.</li>
					<li>If you can't use this website and uphold your abstinence of nonfree software, please <a href="/contact">let me know</a> how to fix it.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Sorry bout the jank all around, i'm still figuring out a lot of this and willing my blurry <a href="/misc/website-principles">vision of a website</a> into reality with my limited webdev skill and the constraints i've set for myself is kinda hard ngl :")</li>
			<li>If there's a chance you know me by a different name or handle, you might wanna <a href="/about">double check that you've got the right guy</a>.</li>
			<li>Please don't sue me over the url or anything i just thought it would be a hehe funi kinda thing, please <a href="/contact">reach out to me</a> if you're gonna get legal on my ass.</li>
