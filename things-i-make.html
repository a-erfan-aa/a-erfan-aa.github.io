	<h3>Things i'm actively working on</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>i'm trying to finish off my final sem project so i can get my diploma</li>
				<ul>
					<li>it's taking forever because there's human interaction involved and i was gonna get it started as the great germ tomfoolery started</li>
					<li>i should probably focus on jobhunting more now so i can jump right into it once my diploma's done</li>
						<ul>
							<li>then i need to think of degree plans and if that's even a good idea and what and where to study and costs and aaaaaa</li>
						</ul>

	<h3>Things i'm passively working on</h3>
	<p>I'd like to focus more on these but well with my diploma looming over my head focus isn't easy to maintain</p>
		<ul>
			<li>i'm making a bunch of music to release as albums/EPs/collections someday in the far future</li>
				<ul>
					<li>i'm currently still just writing, i have absolutely no demos recorded yet</li>
					<li>i'd say that i'm maybe... 10% done with writing the first set of pieces/songs...? Which is a very little amount of progress overall</li>
					<li>oddly enough i've made more progress on the pieces of music i don't intend to release in the 1st collection</li>
				</ul>
			<li>i'm maintaining this website</li>
				<ul>
					<li>it's hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> and i made the domain i bought point here</li>
					<li>more on what i want out of this website <a href="/things-i-make/website-principles.html">here</a></li>
				</ul>
			<li>i sometimes make dumb little videos that i post on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6WnCo8jywKuWI9Vne7Uq_A">my youtube channel</a></li>
				<ul>
