	<p>ok look this is hosted off of a repo on github so you can already figure out what should(n't) be allowed and what i can('t) do, but here's what i gotta say if you're still unsure:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Feel free to inspect the place, just change it up a bit if you decide to copy. I doubt you'd want to tho it's not exactly ✨<span style="color:pink;">𝒶𝑒𝓈𝓉𝒽𝑒𝓉𝒾𝒸</span>✨ or anything</li>
			<li>I'm not collecting your data, and i don't intend to. If i am i'm not aware of how i'm doing it, tell me how to stop aaaa</li>
			<li>You or your guardian(s) should be okay with you reading words like fuck, shit, piss and/or cum</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If that's not okay, please leave right the fuck now</li>
					<li>If this is your first time learning about these words, you didn't hear them from me</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
