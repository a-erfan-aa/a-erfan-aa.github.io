	<h3>A few things before you go on reading...</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I just like these things okay i'm no expert on any of em</li>
			<li>These are all personal opinions, i'm not saying anything here is <i>objectively</i> good</li>
			<li>I try to list things in here regardless of their fanbases</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Most of the time an audience is cool but sometimes people are <a href="https://archive.is/uJceS">cringe</a>, myself included :")</li>
				</ul>
			<li>I try to list things in here regardless of whoever made them</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Because of that, you might see names like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll">C. Dodgson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner">R. Wagner</a> because i think their works are very entertaining or important, in spite of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll#Controversies_and_mysteries">questionable</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner#Controversies">stuff</a> surrounding them.</li>
					<li>That being said, there should be names like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9q4FW3t7AasK7o49C-Mq6w">Gus & Eddy</a> that i put in here because they make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpIafFPGutTAKOBHMtGen7g">good</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EddyBurback">stuff</a> <i>AND</i> they seem like swell folk too even tho i've never known them personally</li>
				</ul>
			<li>I try to come back and update this page often because thinking about things i like and why i like them makes me feel nice</li>

<!-- a buncha scripts so filtering through the big list is easier
huge huge thanks to w3schools because the js code is easy to understand, copy and tweak to my needs
afaik this is free js since it's readable and it doesn't collect data unannounced
and if i were a user that's all i'd like out of the scripts my browser wants me to run
-->

<!-- hide and show filters, stole this from w3schools -->

<!-- filter through showing/hiding table rows, showing all if nothing is checked, and showing what matches all checked boxes if some are checked -->

<!-- sort columns in table wikipedia style
I'll get on this in the future if i decide that i need it, like if i add another column to the table or something -->
