	<h3>So yeah...</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>it makes me think good</li>
				<ul>
					<li>post2000pre2010 mathrock shenanigans are everywhere in this album</li>
					<li>twinkly riffs</li>
					<li>bpm go nyoom mostly</li>
					<li>real unconventional song structure</li>
					<li>the unpredictability of sections just st-</li>
					<li>can't forget to mention time changes</li>
					<li>-opping and starting again</li>
					<li>rich harmony that isn't overbearing</li>
				</ul>
			<li>it makes me feel good</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Even with all the chaos there's wonderful lyrics and melodies to hang on to</li>
					<li>I've never truly been emo i've never had my MCR phase and yet... there's something about the words Stu's written that always gets me.</li>
					<li>It keeps me grounded in trying to receive and give music as a person too instead of just someone who only knows music theory</li>
					<li>I've gotten to know this album a lot better at an important time in my life</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
	<p>and with the 2018 acoustic release, it just feels like so comforting, it's as if i've taken some time to grow without the album and when i met it again in a new light it felt like a warm hug</p>
