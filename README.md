my personal website, [onlyerfans.com](https://onlyerfans.com/), hosted right off of this repo, yeehaw

it's just a buncha simple static pages, feel free to look around and laugh at my dumb commits they're kinda funny to look back on.

oh right also [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so consider this a warning so you're not taken by surprise when you see [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)'s markdown in the middle of a .html or .js
