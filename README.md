my personal website, hosted right off of this repo, yeehaw

woah how'd you end up here? the website's probably back where you came from. in any case feel free to look around and laugh at my dumb commits they're kinda funny to look back on.

oh right also [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so consider this a warning so you're not taken by surprise when you see jekyll's markdown in the middle of a .html or .js
