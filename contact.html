			<li>I'm on <span style="background: #7289da; color: white;">discord</span> a lot of the time, but i keep it for personal stuff and dumbassery as much as possible, or for tasks where the line between fucking around and being productive is really blurred.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>maybe i'll link servers i hang around a lot on here in the future, who knows</li>
				</ul>
			<li>I don't use <a href="https://twitter.com/a_erfan_aa"><span style="background: #00acee;">twitter</span></a> as often but feel free to dm or @ me there i'll probably see it, please ignore the dumb tweets, i was and will continue to be stupid on main.</li>

	<h3>Places you might be able reach me</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>There's a good chance you can reach me over <span style="background-color: #0088cc; color: white;">telegram</span> or <span style="background-color: #25d366; color: white">whatsApp</span> if you need to, just bear in mind i put up with whatsapp because that's what everyone else in the country uses.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you need to reach me over one of those apps, you probably have my number already. If not, you probably know someone who knows me. Try to get it from one of our mutual contacts.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>uhhh if we don't have any mutuals and you need my number i guess you can try your luck through my twitter or instagram</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Hey <span style="color: red;">if you have my phone number please let me know before handing it out to anyone</span> who asks for it thanks.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>I have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/a_erfan_aa/"><span style="background-color: #dd2a7b;">instagram</span></a> account but i don't normally approve follow requests or respond to dms unless i have a decent idea of who's running the account.</li>
			<li>Same story with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/kurtFG"><span style="background: #1b2838;">steam</span></a> or any other video game platforms, i'd love to play video games noncompetitively on the regular with you if i actually... y'know... know you who are.</li>
